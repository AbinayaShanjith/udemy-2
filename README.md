# Udemy-Clone

This project is a **static Udemy clone website** built using **HTML and CSS** as part of my front-end web development learning journey. The goal of this project is to practice creating real-world website layouts and improve my understanding of responsive design.

The website is **fully responsive using CSS Flexbox**, ensuring that the layout adapts smoothly across different screen sizes. It includes essential sections such as a navigation bar, course listings, categories, and a footer. This project focuses purely on **UI and layout design** without using JavaScript or backend technologies.
